<h1 align="center">We believe that everyone deserves to<br> have a voice, and that the world is a<br> better place when we listen, share<br> and build a community through our<br> stories.</h1>

<h1 align="center">Our values are based on four essential<br> freedoms that define who we are.</h1>
<br><br><br><br><br>

<b><font size="10">Freedom of <br><mark>Expression</mark></font></b>
<h3 align="left">We believe that people should be able to speak freely, share<br> opinions, foster open dialogue, and that creative freedom leads to<br> new voices, formats and possibilities.</h3>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<p align="right"><b><font size="10">Freedom of <br><mark>Information</mark></font></b></p>
<h3 align="right">We believe that everyone should have easy, open access to<br> information and that video is a powerful force for education, building<br> understanding and documenting world events, big and small.</h3>
<br><br><br><br>
<p align="left"><b><font size="10">Freedom of <br><mark>Opportunity</mark></font></b></p>
<h3 align="left">We believe that everyone should have a chance to be discovered,<br> build a business and succeed on their own terms, and that people �<br> not gatekeepers � decide what's popular.</h3>
<br><br><br><br>
<p align="right"><b><font size="10">Freedom to <mark> Belong</mark></font></b></p>
<h3 align="right">We believe that everyone should be able to find communities of<br> support, break down barriers, transcend borders and come together<br> around shared interests and passions.</h3>
